# EndTech Additions

Mod which adds small features for both the server and the client. Made for EndTech.

# Features
## Custom Objectives
Add 4 new scoreboard criterias: `minecraft.custom:minecraft.all`, `如icks`, `存hovels`, `地xes`. 
These will count every block mined with these tools, no matter the type. `地ll` will count every block mined, no matter the tool!

Block tag scoreboards: Custom objectives that count by block type\
Ex: `minecraft.custom:minecraft.used_trapdoors` will count every trapdoor used, no matter the type\
Automatically create and update block tag scoreboards using [every-scoreboard](https://github.com/samipourquoi/every-scoreboard)

## Scoreboard Totals
Add totals to scoreboards: `et-additions scoreboardTotals true`, `...false`.\
This adds a display on the sidebar to show the total of all tracked players for that objective

## Perfect trades highlighter
An easy way to see if a trade is perfect. If it is, it will add a yellow arrow instead of the normal white one. Only supports books
at the moment.
